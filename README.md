#PoC for running maven build within wum-client

Since we are planning to provide updates as feature updates for C5 based products, bug fixes and enhancements will be delivered as new versions of relevant features which needs to be installed on the product by uninstalling the existing version. With the recent change in plans, this process needs to be performed at the client side assuming that the client is already having Java pre installed in his system. This PoC is performed to ensure that wum-client can perform a maven build without having the requirement of maven being installed in the client's system.

###Steps to execute
####Building the executable

Run `go install update-c5-products.go ` to create the executable.

####Hosting resources

Since the program is hardcoded to use `http://10.100.1.85:8454/p2-repo/` server for `p2-repo` and `http://10.100.1
.85:8484` server for obtaining `pom.xml` (this will be dynamically generated by the `wum-server` for feature upgrades 
and a sample `pom.xml` is available inside the `sample` directory) 
and 
`apache maven` 
distribution, 
please host 
two  
different servers on the above addresses containing the relevant resources for running the executable. (Note : The 
relevant binaries and resource files were not added as this is a PoC)

####Running the executable

Place the C5 based product zip at the same location of the executable (formed above) and run the formed executable.
